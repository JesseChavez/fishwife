 is a high-performance Rack adapter for JRuby apps,
based on the latest version of the Jetty webserver 
(http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/)

To use rack-handler-jetty with your Rack app:

    gem install rack-handler-jetty
    cd /path/to/my/app
    jetty

We get our performance by implementing a direct servlet-to-rack bridge 
via JRuby's Java integration layer.

The numbers speak for themselves:

    ruby 1.9.1p243

    Mongrel
    Webrick
    Thin

    JRuby 1.5.0RC1 on Java SE Server VM 1.6.0_17-b04

    Mongrel
    Webrick
    rack-handler-jetty
    Jetty+Warbler
    Tomcat+Warbler

rack-handler-jetty also provides access to the underlaying servlet
context, allowing for runtime additions of additional servlets and
filters.  We plan on using this to tie in the cometd servlet
as a piece of Rack middleware, which will provide a simple way to 
add Comet funtionality, via the Bayeux protocol, to any Rack 
application.

Note that rack-handler-jetty is NOT a direct replacement for jruby-rack
or Warbler, as we don't produce WAR files or make any attempt to package
a Rack application for installation in a Java web container.  Rather, we
just make it really easy to use Jetty as a webserver for your Rack
applications.
